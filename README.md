# bouncing-balls
Remember the bouncing banner from VHS screensavers? Yeah, this is it but with more balls.


I build this project using JavaScript's object oriented side. The balls are a class and every ball is an object.
This project is an assesment of the skills I aquired while following MDN Web Docs tutorial on JavaScript objects.
